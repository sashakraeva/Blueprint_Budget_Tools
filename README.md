# Blueprint-Budget-Tools

A Python-based repository for architecture and construction students to explore image processing and cost estimation concepts through two focused exercises and a combined app.

## Contents

1. **[Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb)**  
   Analyze blueprint images using OpenCV to detect walls, room boundaries, and calculate room areas.

2. **[Flooring Cost Estimator](flooring_cost_estimator/)**  
   Calculate flooring costs for rooms based on dimensions and material choices. A beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming concepts.

3. **[Blueprint & Budget Builder](combined_app/)**  
   A combined application integrating blueprint analysis with material cost estimation, allowing users to seamlessly calculate construction costs from blueprint images.

## **1. [Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb)**

This project introduces architecture students to the basics of OpenCV through a practical exercise in image processing. The program processes blueprint images, highlights walls and room boundaries, and calculates areas of detected rooms. Itâ€™s designed for beginners to learn Python and OpenCV while applying programming skills to an architecture-related task.

#### Learning Objectives

- Learn the basics of OpenCV for image processing.
- Understand how to load, display, and manipulate images in Python.
- Use edge detection and contour analysis to extract shapes from images.
- Perform calculations like area measurement based on image data.

#### Features

- Load and Display Blueprint
- Load a blueprint image from a file.
- Display the image in a separate window.
- Convert the image to grayscale to simplify processing.
- Edge Detection to highlight walls and boundaries.
- Contour Detection to identify closed areas (like rooms).
- Calculate Room Areas

#### How to Run

1. Open Google Colab Notebook [Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb).
2. Make a copy of it and save it to you drive/github.
3. Upload images: 1st exercise: [four_squares](blueprints/four_squares.png) 2nd exercise: [simple_square](blueprints/simple_square.png) from [blueprints](blueprints/) folder
4. Work with Google Colab cell-by-cell to analyze the process and see the result
5. Enjoy!
