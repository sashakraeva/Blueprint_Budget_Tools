# Blueprint-Budget-Tools

A Python-based repository for architecture and construction students to explore image processing and cost estimation concepts through two focused exercises and a combined app.

## Contents

1. **[Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb)**  
   Analyze blueprint images using OpenCV to detect walls, room boundaries, and calculate room areas.

2. **[Flooring Cost Estimator](flooring_cost_estimator/)**  
   Calculate flooring costs for rooms based on dimensions and material choices. A beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming concepts.

3. **[Blueprint & Budget Builder](combined_app/)**  
   A combined application integrating blueprint analysis with material cost estimation, allowing users to seamlessly calculate construction costs from blueprint images.

## **1. [Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb)**

This project introduces architecture students to the basics of OpenCV through a practical exercise in image processing. The program processes blueprint images, highlights walls and room boundaries, and calculates areas of detected rooms. Itâ€™s designed for beginners to learn Python and OpenCV while applying programming skills to an architecture-related task.

#### Learning Objectives

- Learn the basics of OpenCV for image processing.
- Understand how to load, display, and manipulate images in Python.
- Use edge detection and contour analysis to extract shapes from images.
- Perform calculations like area measurement based on image data.

#### Features

- Load and Display Image:
     - there are several ways to upload the files to google colab. We can do it through google colab files, conecting the notebook to google drive folder, or calling the files from repository in GitHub.
- Display the image in a separate window.
     - To display several pictures at the same time for better analysis we can use matplotlib to plot them.
- Convert the image to grayscale to simplify processing.
     - To convert image to grayscale we can use cv2 library
- Edge Detection to highlight walls and boundaries.
     - To detect edges Canny and Scharr methods were used
- Contour Detection to identify closed areas (like rooms).
     - Several trials were maid to detect accurate amount of contours. The problem faced: it was doubling the amount of contours
     - How it was solved:
          Why x*2 contours were appearing previously?
            - Canny Edge Detection: This detects all edges in the image, including both the inner and outer edges of the rectangle.
            - Contours Detection: The cv2.findContours function sees each edge separately because it traces boundaries around both the inner and outer edges.
            - Result: Since there are two loops (one for the outer rectangle and one for the inner hollow rectangle) and each loop has two sides (inner and outer edges), the function detects 4 separate contours.
         Why 2 contours?
            - Thresholding was included: Converts the grayscale image into a binary image (black and white). The black areas are treated as the background, and the white areas represent the shape.
            - Here, the entire rectangle (both outer and inner parts) is treated as a single filled shape with two boundaries: outer and inner.
            - Contours Detection: The cv2.findContours function detects only the outer boundary of the shape and the hole inside it.
            - Result:The algorithm detects 2 contours: one for the outer boundary of the rectangle and one for the inner hollow space.
- Calculate Room Areas

#### Tools & Libraries
- GoogleCollab
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot)

#### How to Run

1. Open Google Colab Notebook [Blueprint Analyzer](Blueprint_Analyzer_Aleksandra_Kraeva.ipynb).
2. Make a copy of it and save it to you drive/github.
3. Upload images: 1st exercise: [four_squares](blueprints/four_squares.png) 2nd exercise: [simple_square](blueprints/simple_square.png) from [blueprints](blueprints/) folder
4. Work with Google Colab cell-by-cell to analyze the process and see the result
5. Enjoy!
