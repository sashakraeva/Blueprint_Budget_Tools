# Blueprint-Budget-Tools

A Python-based repository for architecture and construction students to explore image processing and cost estimation concepts through two focused exercises and a combined app.

## Contents

1. **[Blueprint Analyzer](blueprint_analyzer/)**  
   Analyze blueprint images using OpenCV to detect walls, room boundaries, and calculate room areas. Ideal for learning image processing basics.

2. **[Flooring Cost Estimator](flooring_cost_estimator/)**  
   Calculate flooring costs for rooms based on dimensions and material choices. A beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming concepts.

3. **[Blueprint & Budget Builder](combined_app/)**  
   A combined application integrating blueprint analysis with material cost estimation, allowing users to seamlessly calculate construction costs from blueprint images.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the required libraries:
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- Any additional libraries specific to each exercise (noted in individual READMEs).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blueprint-Budget-Tools.git
   cd Blueprint-Budget-Tools
